# This bash will update the modification time of files in the current folder
# earlier by a given param in hours.
# This script is written by ChatGPT(facinating? isn't it), I fixed a bug and made some tweaks though.
#
# Why there is such a script. It's because GoPro writes a wrong time in the
# video files. I guess it's because GoPro doesn't know my timezone so it writes
# GMT instead, so the date and time in string is correct(as in my timezone)
# but wrong timezone, it causes certain time diff between my timezone and GMT.
# So this script is to correct them.

# Get the current folder path
folder_path="$(pwd)"

# Get the time to subtract from the modification time in hours
read -p "Enter the time to subtract from the modification time in hours: " time_diff

# Convert time difference to seconds
time_diff_seconds=$((time_diff * 3600))

echo "Confirm the following changes:"

# Loop through all files in the folder
for file in "$folder_path"/*
do
    echo $file
  # Check if the file is a regular file
  if [ -f "$file" ]
  then
    # Get the current modification time in seconds since the epoch
    mod_time=$(stat -f "%m" "$file")

    # Convert the modification time to a human-readable format
    mod_time_formatted=$(date -r "$mod_time" +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    # Calculate the new modification time in a human-readable format
    new_mod_time=$(date -r "$(($mod_time - $time_diff_seconds))" +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    # Print the original and new modification times for the file
    echo "File: $file" "$mod_time_formatted" " -> " "$new_mod_time"
